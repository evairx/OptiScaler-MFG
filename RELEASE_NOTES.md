# OptiScaler-MFG v10.0.1 (Pre-release)

Welcome to the pre-release of **OptiScaler-MFG (v10.0.1)**! 🚀 🎮

This release introduces **Unified Intelligent GPU Architecture Detection** for Multi-Frame Generation across all modern NVIDIA RTX GPUs:
- **RTX 40 Series (Ada Lovelace)**: Runs on the native in-memory Blackwell retargeting engine (2X to 6X).
- **RTX 30 Series (Ampere)**: Automatically routes to the optimized SM86 PTX JIT engine (2X to 4X) with zero input delay and exact sampling.
- **RTX 20 Series (Turing)**: Automatically routes to the optimized SM75 PTX JIT engine (2X to 4X) without visual bugs.

A single, intelligent **"Unlock MFG"** button in the OptiScaler menu identifies your hardware and routes to the optimal path automatically!

### 🌟 Major Highlights & New Features

#### 🧠 Intelligent Unified Multi-Frame Engine (RTX 20 / RTX 30 / RTX 40)
- **Automatic Architecture Detection**:
  - Detects your GPU model and architecture ID automatically on startup.
  - The menu shows your detected GPU architecture: `Ada (RTX 40)`, `Ampere (RTX 30)`, or `Turing (RTX 20)`.
  - Toggling **Unlock MFG** automatically engages the correct unlock path without requiring manual configuration or conflicting settings.
- **Ampere & Turing Native Sideloading (SM86 / SM75)**:
  - Sideloads `OptiScaler/dlssg_sm86/dlssg_sm86.dll` in a safe background worker outside `DllMain`.
  - Generates companion `dlssg_sm86.ini` dynamically:
    - Sets `KernelImage=PTX` for driver JIT compilation to eliminate black screens and broken cubin ABI mismatches.
    - Sets `HardwareBilinear=0` to ensure exact sampling and eliminate visual ghosting or blur.
    - Preserves low latency Reflex markers for responsive controls with zero extra input delay.
- **Ada Lovelace Native In-Memory Retargeting (RTX 40)**:
  - Preserves the proven zero-allocation Blackwell `sm_120` -> `sm_89` in-place kernel retargeting for ratios up to 6X.
  - Retains in-memory redirection of older game-bundled DLSS-G to OptiScaler's modern v310.7.129 package.
- **Definitive Multi-Frame Architecture (2X, 3X, 4X, 5X, 6X)**:
  - Fully incorporates and ports the ReShade `MFGAdaUnlock-RenoDx` engine directly into OptiScaler's native binary (`dxgi.dll`) without needing ReShade, external hooks, or sidecar add-ons.
  - **In-Memory Dynamic Redirection of DLSS-G & Streamline**:
    - When a game attempts to load an older bundled DLSS-G (such as v3.7.0 in *Silent Hill 2*), OptiScaler intercepts the `LoadLibrary` call in memory and automatically redirects it to OptiScaler's modern `nvngx_dlssg.dll` v310.7.129.0 package.
    - Completely eliminates the `partial match (Adv:0 Val:0 Kernels:0)` error and unlocks all 31 midpoint interpolation containers.
  - **In-Place Dynamic Kernel Retargeting (`sm_120` -> `sm_89`)**:
    - Rewrites Blackwell interpolation kernels to Ada Lovelace architecture directly in memory upon DLL loading.
    - Completely eliminates crashes when switching between 2X, 3X, 4X, and 6X modes.
  - **Zero-Flicker Midpoint Temporal Reconstruction**:
    - Decompresses Fatbin PTX and rewrites the interpolation kernel to inject dynamic temporal progress parameters (`%f134` and `%f136`) instead of the hardcoded `0.5f` midpoint constant.
    - Eliminates stuttering, duplicate cadence frames, and judder in 3X, 4X, and 6X modes.
  - **Automatic Software Pacing (RSYNC) & Freeze Prevention**:
    - Derives and pins DLSS-G's flip metering offset dynamically from `sl.dlss_g.dll`, forcing fallback onto the software RSYNC pacer.
    - Prevents Blackwell hardware flip metering waits on Ada (RTX 40), eliminating black screens and frozen frames in 3X, 4X, and 6X modes.
    - Matches the ReShade `MFGAdaUnlock-RenoDx` architecture gate rewrite (`0x190`), with automated pacing checks before passing requests.
  - **Clean Native Resource & Struct Flow (Anti-Crash & Zero Black Lines)**:
    - Preserves all game scene buffers and original Streamline struct versions intact without artificial overrides or tag zeroing.
    - Completely prevents crashes and eliminates black lines and black screens in Unreal Engine 5 (*Black Myth: Wukong*, *Silent Hill 2*).
- **Turing & Ampere Hardware Support (RTX 20 & RTX 30 series)**:
  - Bypasses architecture locks in NVIDIA DLSS-G via runtime PTX instruction redirection and dynamic gate patching.
  - Multi-frame generation executes directly on hardware **Tensor Cores** with native performance and minimum latency.

#### 🛠️ Seamless In-Game Menu & Flow
- **Direct "Unlock MFG" Toggle**:
  - `Unlock MFG` is always available and clickable in the menu under the *MFG RTX 20/30/40* section.
  - Clean restart workflow:
    - When enabled during gameplay, a clear reminder is displayed:
      `Save Settings and restart the game for MFG to take effect.`
    - Once the game is restarted with `Unlock MFG` enabled, the status confirms:
      `MFG is active and running on Tensor Cores.`
    - The **Multi-Frame Ratio** selector is unlocked, allowing you to choose between **Default (Game), 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X, and 6X**.
- **Memory & Crash Protections**:
  - Implemented strict Streamline structure version boundary checking to prevent stack overflows and memory corruption in Unreal Engine 5 games (such as *Silent Hill 2*).
  - Clean swapchain handling preventing DXGI access violations during initialization.
- **Custom Branding**:
  - OptiScaler in-game UI displays: `evairx/optiscaler-mfg v10.0.1 - <GameExe>`.

### 🎮 Installation Instructions

1. **Extract all files**:
   - For **Unreal Engine** games (e.g., *Silent Hill 2*, *Black Myth: Wukong*, *Star Wars Jedi: Survivor*):
     Extract the archive directly into the directory where the shipping binary lives, e.g.:
     `<GameFolder>\SHProto\Binaries\Win64\` (or `<GameFolder>\<GameCode>\Binaries\Win64\`), **NOT** in the root launcher folder.
   - For standard games:
     Extract into the main folder where the game's `.exe` is located.
2. Run `setup_windows.bat` (or rename `OptiScaler.dll` to `dxgi.dll`).
3. Launch the game and press **`Insert`** to open the OptiScaler menu.
4. Check **`Unlock MFG`**, click **Save Settings**, and restart the game.
5. On the next launch, enjoy native DLSS Frame Generation running on your Tensor Cores!
